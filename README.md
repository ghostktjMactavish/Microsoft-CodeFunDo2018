#Disaster Management using Tweets

During a natural disaster social media is full of information about the current situation of the affected regions.Twitter is one such platform which is filled with tweets about the current calamity.One such case was the Tokyo Earthquakes in 2017 when there was an abundance of tweets describing the current conditions of the people affected by the earthquakes.These tweets can be a very useful source of information for the disaster management teams.These tweets can be classified into a variety of topics.Some of these topics are :

Destruction caused by the natural disaster.
Scarcity of important supplies like food,medicine,etc.
People in need of rescue.
Current state of the useful facilities, eg. destruction of hospitals.

The list is not limited to these.But some of the tweets fall in to categories which are of no use to disaster management teams, eg.tweets linking the destruction to political and religious causes.

I intend to cluster these tweets into different categories based on the topic wnder which they fall and map them geographically.This will help the disaster management teams in filtering out useful information and taking necessary measures for the given situation.I would also create a frequency vs time chart for the different category of tweets.This would help them in assessing the current situation of the affected region,eg.the frequency of tweets about the impact and destruction would be more in the beginning while those about rescue and shortage of supplies would be more at later times.

I will use a labeled dataset of tweets from Crisislex.org.
